Thank you for be reading this. 
The objective of this PHP program is to get the amount to be pay to as many as workers you add in the database. 
You can read/edit this database in the file named jobhours.txt that is included in 'files' folder.
It's important that you use the same structure for every row according to the next explanation:
ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00
The first word is the name of the employee, then it comes the "=" symbol.
For identifying the days of the week, you need to use these abbreviations:
MO: Monday
TU: Tuesday
WE: Wednesday
TH: Thursday
FR: Friday
SA: Saturday
SU: Sunday
The price for each worked hour is defined by the next table:
Monday - Friday
00:01 - 09:00 25 USD
09:01 - 18:00 15 USD
18:01 - 00:00 20 USD
Saturday and Sunday
00:01 - 09:00 30 USD
09:01 - 18:00 20 USD
18:01 - 00:00 25 USD

Each day needs to be followed by the correct schedule (HH:00,HH:00) separated by a comma.
